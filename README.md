### Title: Task-Manager
#### Description: A task manager application that has functionality to add users, add tasks, view tasks assigned, generate reports and display statistics from those reports.



Installation:
This project is written in Python 3.8.10 and saved in the .py format. The project should run in any IDE that can run Python files. The program is entirely console-based, so there are no extra libraries or dependencies to configure. Just make sure that the `user.txt` and `tasks.txt` files are saved in the same directory as the project file. 

Usage:
The project is interactive, and the different options are shown once run. It will ask for a username and password to open the program. The default login is: `username: admin` | `password: password`. 

You will be able to add and view tasks for the user logged in, as well as for all users. For individual tasks, there is the option to change its completion status, change  the due date or assign the task to another user. When logged in as admin, there is additional functionality to generate a text file with task information, and to display task statistics in the console.
